checkmate mirrors checkbox selections between two sets of checkboxes.

Handy for use if you have input fields outside of the form (for whatever reason).

To use:
* Make sure jQuery + the checkmate plugin are loaded in your page
* Make sure that your "fake" inputs and your "real" inputs have the same "name" attribute
* give all of your "fake" inputs the same class. In this demo, I used "control"
* Add the checkmate() function to a clickhandler on your "fake" inputs

Check the demo file in the repo for an example.
